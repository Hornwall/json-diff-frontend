# Json diff frontend

This is a frontend designed to interact with the [JSON diff API](https://github.com/c0d3m0nkey/json-diff-api) to make it easier to find changes and spot potential errors in large data sources. The application is built as a single page web application using [angular js](https://angularjs.org/).
## Improvements
This app only contains the basic functionality needed to list and diff data sources and files with some basic functionality specific to [NSL](http://nsl.mpa.se/). More domain specific functionality would need to be added to make it more usable within a given organisation.
